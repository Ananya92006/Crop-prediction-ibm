## ðŸ“– Overview

The **Crop Yield Prediction** system uses various environmental and agricultural features (such as temperature, rainfall, soil type, and crop type) to predict the yield of a particular crop in a given region. The model is trained on historical agricultural data and can assist in precision farming.



## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks**:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - Joblib or Pickle (for model saving)
- **Model**: Regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)


## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle/UCI/Food and Agriculture Organization, India Govt Data, etc.]
- **Features**:
  - Crop type
  - State/Region
  - Rainfall (mm)
  - Temperature (Â°C)
  - Soil Type
  - Area (hectares)
  - Fertilizer used (kg/hectare)
- **Target**: Yield (kg/hectare)

> You may need to preprocess the data: handle missing values, encode categorical features, and normalize/scale data.
